# Bioinformatics Practice Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of bioinformatics challenges sourced from two excellent platforms: 
**Rosalind** and **Biocode Daily**.
These platforms offer a range of problems designed to test and improve problem-solving skills in the field of bioinformatics.

## Rosalind

[Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) is a problem-solving platform focused on bioinformatics. 
It provides an extensive set of challenges that cover key topics such as DNA and RNA sequence analysis, algorithms, and computational biology.

You can view my progress and completed problems on my [Rosalind profile](https://rosalind.info/users/dawnandrew/).

## Biocode Daily

[Biocode Daily](https://www.biocodedaily.com/archive) presents multiple bioinformatics challenges weekly, primarily to be solved using Python.
The problems often focus on real-world biological problems, providing great practice for applied bioinformatics skills.

Each day, problems that present both an easy and a hard challenge are released, covering topics such as gene expression normalization, RNA structure prediction, and more.

## Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a collection of challenging mathematical and computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
While mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills is required to solve most problems.
The platform aims to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Goals

My goal is to complete all challenges using multiple programming languages to broaden my skills and approach. The languages I plan to use include:
